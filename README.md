## Web Performance Metrics Summary

### Key Metrics:

1. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**:

   - Quantifies visual stability.
   - High CLS indicates visual instability.

2. **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**:

   - Time from page start to first content render.
   - Important for perceived load speed.

3. **First Input Delay (FID)**:

   - Time from user interaction to browser response.
   - High FID indicates unresponsiveness.

4. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**:

   - Render time of largest content since page load.
   - Reflects when main content is visible.

5. **Experimental Time to First Byte (TTFB)**:
   - Time for the first byte from the server.
   - Indicates server response times.

### Aggregated Metrics:

- **p75 Metric**: Represents 75th percentile value.
- **Histogram Metric**: Represents distribution of a dataset.

### Recommendations for Table Display:

Prioritize the following metrics for a non-technical audience:

- **FCP and LCP** for load performance.
- **FID** for responsiveness.
- **CLS** for visual stability.

Display average values or percentiles for a clear performance view.
